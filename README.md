### Project Description: Student Chatbot Application

The **Student Chatbot Application** is an interactive and educational tool designed to assist users in understanding key concepts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and related topics. Built with **Streamlit**, the app combines predefined question-answer pairs and dynamic information retrieval from **Wikipedia** to provide users with concise and relevant responses to their queries. This project aims to enhance learning by delivering accurate information in a conversational format.

#### Key Features:
1. **Predefined Responses**:  
   The chatbot includes a repository of predefined answers for commonly asked questions about AI and its subfields, ensuring instant and accurate responses.

2. **Dynamic Wikipedia Integration**:  
   For queries not covered in the predefined list, the chatbot fetches relevant information directly from **Wikipedia** using its API, providing users with a broader range of knowledge.

3. **Chat History**:  
   The app maintains a seamless conversation flow by storing and displaying the entire chat history, allowing users to track their questions and answers.

4. **Natural Query Handling**:  
   The chatbot intelligently handles multiple queries separated by "and" in a single input, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly interaction.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   Robust error handling is implemented for ambiguous queries, page errors, or connection issues, ensuring the chatbot provides useful feedback in case of difficulties.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**:  
   Built with **Streamlit**, the application features a clean and intuitive interface with a responsive chat layout that accommodates dynamic interactions.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Streamlit**: For developing the web-based interface and managing the user interaction flow.
- **Streamlit Chat**: To create a conversational chatbot experience.
- **Wikipedia API**: For fetching real-time information dynamically.
- **Python**: For backend logic, query handling, and integration.

#### Applications:
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and beginners looking to explore AI, machine learning, and related fields.
- **Quick Reference**: Useful for professionals or enthusiasts seeking concise explanations of technical topics.
- **Community Engagement**: Can be expanded to support various topics and promote learning in diverse fields.

This project highlights the integration of static knowledge bases with dynamic content retrieval, creating a hybrid chatbot that bridges the gap between predefined and exploratory learning.
